        <p>I find both flat and skeuo to be effective in their own rights, as each camp can appeal to different audiences than eachother, though I find myself more in the flat ideological camp. While skeuo design is effective in introducing new design elements to users, and can make the identification of a design’s function easier, it can also be clunky, difficult to use if it does not complete the function of its real life counterpart, and can also look overwhelming. However, flat design feels more simplistic and easy to follow, and forms are simplified yet still recognizable. Flat design also feels much more consistent as since it is so widespread, the different design states of flat design are widely understood, and therefore can be interpreted the same way when users use different devices or interfaces. This makes it easier to make intuitive design that is both attractive, and feels easy to use.<br><br>
            A zoopraxiscope is a device that had photographs on a glass disc like frames, and while it was spun with light shining through behind it, it would be projected, giving movement and animating the photos. It resembles the gifs we encounter today in that it is a short, looping animation, and its projection marks one of “the origins of screens”. It also makes use of the same principles that digital designers do, in that motion, time, and change are big principles that we also consider in our work, just as early filmmakers did. Another example that inspired digital design is the hypothetical “memex”, which was envisioned by Vannevar Bush; the memex was meant to be a device that would store all of the user's books, papers, and records and would allow them to quickly and easily access them. The records would be permanent, and essentially supplement the user’s memory by its permanence and ease of access. This applies to digital design in that these ideas are still considered today when designing digital interactions and interfaces, where we strive to create experiences that will allow users to access their own information quickly and intuitively as well.<br><br>
            I do agree that screens want flux as it plays into a large part of our interaction with screens and is something that is constantly considered in digital design and screens. Screens and software are always evolving, which means flux is inevitable and a necessary part of development. Screens want flux because it not only exists for aesthetic purposes, but also to allow users to interact with a design, understand function, and provide context to the design as well. Change, adaptability, and motion are all important things to consider in digital design, and screens rely on flux as a large part to embody these ideas; a combination of flux allows for users to have a more seamless experience, and it might enhance the experience, or simply make it easier to understand. If screens were static or unchanging, they would be incredibly difficult to navigate, and unpleasant to use, highlighting the necessity of flux.
