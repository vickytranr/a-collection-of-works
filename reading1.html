        <a href="http://howtocrit.com/">How To Crit</a>

        <p>A challenge I face when giving a critique is making sure that my feedback is not based on personal preference, where it's important to be able to distinguish someone's style from parts of the work that are unsuccessful. I also have troubles with being able to critique on the spot, and in the end struggle to find anything to say once others are able to state their own critiques. Being able to rely on my intuition is an important skill that I'll further develop throughout my career. There is also a part of me that is worried about being rude when giving critique, but drawing from the reading, focusing on suggestive feedback such as trying out something new can really help. According to the reading, it also helps to simply describe what you see, as I didn't realize even describing my interpretation of someone's work could also provide valuable insight and feedback.<br><br>
            When receiving a critique I disagree, I generally try to understand where it is being applied and where it is coming from; I try not to dismiss feedback right away, and keep it in mind for the future. I always find it is important to consider many perspectives as in the moment, I may not be able to see how it applies, but sitting on the critique might give me more time to consider it. I also find that there is no harm in trying out suggestions I might think may not work, and simply trying new things might provide further insights into my project and future work. I find almost all feedback to be helpful in one way or another; it may not improve the particular thing I am focusing on, but it may help me better myself as a designer and give me a new perspective on how to approach my work.<br><br>
            I think it is important to give and receive critiques because as designers who will spend a lot of time in our bubbles working on projects, it helps to gain new perspectives and literally see it through a different eye. By receiving critiques, it allows us to see new insights that we might not have previously considered from people who have completely different experiences and thoughts as our own, which allows not only our work to grow, but also ourselves. Depending on the critique's format, it could also allow others to learn from our work, and overall makes feedback more accessible and allows all participants to benefit. In giving critiques, we can learn to think more critically about our own work as well, and might even help us to better connect to how a viewer will react to our work once we are able to talk about someone else's work and the conversations they begin. </p>
