        <p>I think Lialina thinks of the word “user” as something that is still important and necessary to consider when creating interfaces, as she reflects on how previous designers such as Don Norman have rejected it in pursuit of humanizing the people who use interfaces. She finds it important to acknowledge that there is still “a programmed system you use”, where the over emphasis on the “people” that use interfaces can cause designers to think less about the interfaces they design. To Lialina, it seems that “user” is not a taboo word, and is just as important in considering the person using a design. She finds it is also important to consider how the user is someone who holds a semblance of control over the systems they use, and that it is important that the term distinguishes between the developer and the user in order to also consider the user’s rights.<br><br>
            Lialina’s ideal internet user is the General Purpose User, or Turing Complete User. They are able to achieve their goals regardless of programs and find solutions to their problems without relying on specific applications to solve them. These users are able to adapt to technology themselves, and are informed and knowledgeable technologically and of their capabilities. They are able to be autonomous and achieve their goals without help from a specifically designed program or site. Instead of being the invisible user that she criticizes, being a Turing Complete User “makes the user visible, most importantly to themselves”. They could create their own tools and solutions most convenient for them instead. <br><br>
            From my own experiences, an example of a gap that can be filled by users is that of a portfolio; a portfolio can be completely controlled by its creators and fulfill all of the needs they have. A portfolio can include a contact page without the use of social media, a gallery instead of Instagram, and even a personal blog. The user has the control to edit the appearance and function of a portfolio, and would not need to rely on other applications to provide solutions to these tasks and instead they could manage those aspects themselves. By having all of these functions on one page, they would not need to rely on individual programs to complete these simple tasks. Instead of depending on another website to host their portfolio, an artist could effectively build their own which would give them the freedom to create their own solutions and be self sustainable.
