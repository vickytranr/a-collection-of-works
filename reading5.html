        <p>When Seu says to ‘defamiliarize our tools’, I believe she means to encourage us to think more critically about the way we interact with our tools and the digital world, and the meaning we can derive from these interactions. For example, “the mouse is [Seu’s] avatar, clicking and scrolling for utilitarian means”. Beyond being tools, Seu wants us to reflect the poetic potential of the tools we use everyday, and how there is meaning in them. Seu states that beyond being a tool, “technology is a form of language,” and that “perhaps we are so fascinated by the progress of digital technology because it brings us closer to understanding ourselves.” As people who are constantly connected with technology and have become used to the different actions we take to navigate it, defamiliarizing that connection allows us to find meaning in those interactions we often take for granted and to recognize its connection to ourselves.
            With the Performing Data, I believe this category makes use of data in order to create meaning. It uses gathered data, be it a large mass or user input to create a piece of media that creates meaning through its medium; perhaps defamiliarization of the data itself holds significance, or the manipulation of it does. This allows the data to be a poetic device along with the media too to create meaning that can be reflected on. A website I found that operates within this definition is <a class="click" href="https://clickclickclick.click">Click Click Click</a>. The website analyzes the visitor’s actions and system settings and may also compare their stats to others. I find it fits within the definition because although it may not have a traditionally poetic meaning, it relies on a lot of data to operate and effectively forces the user to defamiliarize their actions of interacting with a window, and makes them think more deeply about what they do through its humour and use of data.
