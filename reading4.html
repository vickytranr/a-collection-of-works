        <p>Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media because she believes that creating one’s own website provides the creator a much larger degree of freedom and control over the content and presentation that is presented. With social media, the user’s happiness is less of a priority over the social media’s profit and advertisements. She states that a personal website allows the creator to be both the “author and architect” of their website and can allow much better reflection of the individual as they can control the appearance to suit their needs and preferences, as well as what content is presented unlike on social media sites. There is also total transparency in a website built by the individual, as with social media, there are always underlying business practices that will influence the site that is detrimental to the user’s needs. This transparency is important in a digital world where there are always underlying systems that influence a profit driven society, so beyond even the ability to control the appearance and format of a website, this transparency is important in terms of considering the rights of the user, and the control of the creator. <br>
